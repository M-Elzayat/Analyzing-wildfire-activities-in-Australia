# üî• Analyzing Wildfire Activities in Australia

This project is a data visualization practice assignment from the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. It focuses on analyzing and visualizing wildfire activity data in Australia using Python, with libraries such as **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Folium**.

The goal is to develop hands-on experience in creating effective and insightful plots that support data-driven storytelling.

## üéØ Objectives

By completing this notebook, you will learn how to:

- Load and explore time-series environmental data.
- Create line plots, bar charts, pie charts, histograms, and scatter plots.
- Use advanced Seaborn features like color encoding and stacked distributions.
- Apply date-time transformations and group-by operations.
- Visualize data over time and by categorical regions.
- Enhance charts with titles, labels, gridlines, and legends.
